# Install Redis

1. Create an instance on Redis Cloud with [redis.com](redis.com)
2. To run Redis commands manually, use `rbook.cloud` or use Redis CLI
    - To run RBook locally, run `npx rbook` and navigate to `http://localhost:3050`
    - Any notebook you create will be saved into the same folder that you ran `npx rbook` in.
