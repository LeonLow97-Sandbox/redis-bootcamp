If the system crashes, the data is lost and not persistent. - Redis is used more for caching, data that is consistently being used, faster than the traditional database. - Redis is typically built on top of traditional databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, ... - Access Redis to check if data is available, otherwise search database for the data, this improves performance by a lot.",
